# Fastify Firebase Functions Starter

This is a starter project for building a serverless API with Fastify and Firebase Functions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/yaaamin/fastify-firebase-functions-starter.git`
2. Change directory: `cd fastify-firebase-functions-starter` (and don't forget to remove Original Git Remote : `git remote remove origin`)
3. Install dependencies: `bun i`
4. Run the development server: `bun serve` (I am using bun, you can use any package manager you like)
